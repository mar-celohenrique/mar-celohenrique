### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have experience in software development using the entire Spring ecosystem, with a focus on Spring Cloud. I like to study new technologies, especially new frameworks, so as to propose technical alternatives to situations encountered on a daily basis and I'm always willing to work with new technologies.

Technologies Highlights
- Java
- Spring Framework
- Spring Security, Spring Cloud, Hibernate, JPA, Rect Native.
- Pivotal Cloud Foundry
- Tools: IntellijIDEA, Jenkins, Eclipse.
- TypeScript
